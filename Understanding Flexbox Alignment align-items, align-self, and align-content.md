# Understanding Flexbox Alignment: align-items, align-self, and align-content

1. **`align-items`**:
   - Applies to the container (flex or grid container).
   - Describes how to align the children (flex or grid items) along the cross-axis (perpendicular to the main axis). For a flex container with `flex-direction: row`, the cross-axis is vertical. For `flex-direction: column`, it's horizontal.
   - Common values include: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch`, and `baseline`.

2. **`align-self`**:
   - Applies to individual flex or grid items.
   - Allows for overriding the `align-items` value for individual items. If `align-items` is set to `center` for the container, but you want one specific item to start at the top/beginning, you'd use `align-self: flex-start` on that item.
   - Takes the same values as `align-items`.

3. **`align-content`**:
   - Applies to the flex or grid container.
   - Describes how multiple lines of items (in a multi-line flex or grid container) should be distributed along the cross-axis. This property takes effect only when there are multiple lines of items. In a single-line flex container, this property will have no effect.
   - Common values include: `flex-start`, `flex-end`, `center`, `stretch`, `space-between`, and `space-around`.

In summary:

- `align-items` is about the alignment of items inside the container along the cross-axis.
- `align-self` allows individual items to override the alignment specified by `align-items`.
- `align-content` defines how the lines inside a multi-line container are aligned along the cross-axis.
